### Innovative Idea
- We want to build a website that acted as a "virtual tour guide". It allows users to share landmarks and various interesting sights in their neighborhood. If visitors to our site think there is one or more places worth visiting nearby, the website can show the easiest way to get there.
- The closest thing to what we're trying to do is Google Niantic's Field Trip. But it was unwilling to accept contributions from users and shut down in 2019. [[FildTrip]](https://nianticlabs.com/blog/fieldtrip/?hl=en)
  > Field Trip was a location based mobile app developed by Niantic 
  >Labs for the Google Glass, Android, and iOS devices first released 
  >in September 2012. The application utilized user location and various 
  >databases in order to provide information and recommendations about 
  >various points of interest in their surroundings.
- The closest approximation that still exists is Atlas Obscura. However, it's also less open to users and more focused on cool things that people might not actually experience but do exist. [[Atlas Obscura]](https://www.atlasobscura.com/)
  >Atlas Obscura is an American-based online magazine and travel company. 
  >It was founded in 2009 by author Joshua Foer and documentary filmmaker/author 
  >Dylan Thuras. It catalogs unusual and obscure travel destinations via 
  >user-generated content. The articles on the website cover a number of topics 
  >including history, science, food, and obscure places.

### Important Components

We need to store the actual landmark location, name, text description, image of the landmark.
- [[Google Maps API]](https://googlemaps.github.io/libraries) - Help Build the Map!
- [[Bootstrap]](https://getbootstrap.com/) - To create modern websites and web apps.
- [[SQl]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) Query data from the database.
